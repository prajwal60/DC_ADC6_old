Git Clone
A clone is a replication or act of creating the copy of a file that exists on your machine instead of somewhere on a website's server.
You can edit the files in your favorite editor with your clone and use Git to monitor your changes without having to be online.
It is linked to the remote version, however, so that changes between the two can be synchronized. 

Git Push
Pushing refers to submitting the committed changes to a remote server, like a GitHub-hosted repository.
When you change something locally, for example, you would like to promote those changes so that others can access them.

Git Pull
Pull applies to when you pick up and combine changes. For example, if someone edited the remote file you're both working on,
you're going to want to pull those changes into your local copy so it's up to date.

Merge conflict 
Merging takes changes from one branch (in the same repository or a fork) and transfers them to another branch.
This often happens as a pull request (which can be known as a merge request) or through the command line.
If there are no conflicting changes, a merge can be done automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface, or can always be done via the command line. 

Git Branches
A branch is a repository parallel version. It is in the repository but does not affect the primary or master branch, 
enabling you to work freely without interrupting the live version. When you've made the changes you want to make, 
you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.

Git commit
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). 
It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") 
that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
