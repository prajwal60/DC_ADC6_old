Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle requires that a class should have only one job. 
So if a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. 
A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.
For e.g:
class  User:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    
    def get_name(self) -> str:
        pass

    def save(self, user: User):
        pass
